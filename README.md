# Mechanical-Clock

- This project was created for the 2021-2022 Science Olympiad event It's About Time
- The goal was to time out an interval between 10 and 300 seconds and then produce a distinct signal
- Points were awarded for how acurately the device timed out the interval
- There was also a written exam on timekeeping history and related physics

- This device was competed by me at the 2022 National tournament hosted by Caltech where we took first place in this event
